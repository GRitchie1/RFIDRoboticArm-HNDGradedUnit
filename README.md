# Graded-Unit RFID Robotic Arm Project

This project was completed as part of my HND Mechatronics Graded Unit.  The client required a robotic arm to pick up, identify and sort items based on RFID codes.

All of the models were designed as part of the project, and are 3D printable.

The code was written as part of the project and utilises CircuitPython due to the vast number of libraries.

This repository will be updated with parts lists and instructions.

## Parts List

## Wiring Diagrams
The wiring diagrams for this project were designed using Fritsing.

## Assembly
To assemble the robotic arm, first ensure that you have got all of the required [parts](#Parts-List).

Next use the following steps to assemble the arm:
1. Insert the bearing into the Base (Top) piece. 
2. Insert the bearing into the Base (Bottom) piece.
3. Place the Top and Bottom pieces of the base together and insert the screws to keep them attached.
4. Insert the M8 bolt into the Mount piece.
5. Attach the mount piece to a piece of support material (such as a plank of wood)
6. Assemble the rest of the robot arm using servo motors and linkage pieces.
7. Place the Robot arm onto the M8 bolt.
8. Attach the driver gear to the servo motor.
9. Mount the servo motor to the support material using the motor mount piece at a suitable distance to allow the gears to interlink.
