# Graded-Unit RFID Robotic Arm Project

This project was completed as part of my HND Mechatronics Graded Unit.  The client required a robotic arm to pick up, identify and sort items based on RFID codes.

All of the models were designed as part of the project, and are 3D printable.

The code was written as part of the project and utilises CircuitPython due to the vast number of libraries.

This repository will be updated with parts lists and instructions.
